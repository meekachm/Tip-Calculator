## React Tip Calculator

### Overview

This project consists of two challenges aimed at practicing React development skills :

1. **Challenge 1:** 
   - Create a React component with an input field and an H1.
   - Utilize the controlled component pattern to store the input value in the component's state.
   - Display the value of the state in the H1.

2. **Challenge 2:**
   - Develop a tip calculator component inspired by Google's tip calculator.
   - Implement controlled components to manage the input values for:
     - Bill amount
     - Tip percentage
     - Split (number of people)
   - Calculate and display:
     - Tip amount
     - Total bill amount
     - Per person amount
   - Ensure that these values update dynamically as the input values change.

**Stretch Challenges**
- Use CSS to style the tip calculator and enhance its visual appeal.
- Format the bill input field to allow decimal values for more precise calculations.
- Implement an additional input field for entering the tip amount directly, which dynamically calculates the tip percentage based on the bill amount.
